I'm Xarri Jorge, a frontend web developer. Welcome to my Github. I am building a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies and languages but I prefer life on the front - UI / UX. I'm also actively improving my design skills and I look for every opportunity to better my UX  and web acessibility game.


### ✔️ I'm currently learning
- Kotlin - For mobile
- Flask - a Python framework for backend web development

<!-- ### 👩‍💻 I'm working on

### 💡 Goals for immediate future is to get familiar with:
- AI / ML - With all the rave, now is good time as ever to pick it up
- Rust - Have heard a lot of good this around this

### 🌴 Fun facts
